# üê† NEMO - The Hebrew Named Entities and Morphology Corpus
Named Entity (NER) annotations of the Hebrew Treebank (Haaretz newspaper) corpus, including: morpheme and token level NER labels, nested mentions, and more.  
We publish the NEMO corpus in the TACL paper *Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO¬≤)* [1], where we use it in extensive experiments and analyses, showing the importance of morphological boundaries for neural modeling of NER in morphologically rich languages. Code for these models and experiments can be found in the [NEMO code repo](https://github.com/OnlpLab/NEMO).

## Main features:
1. Morpheme, token-single and token-multi sequence labels. Morpheme labels provide exact boundaries, token-multi provide partial sub-word morphological but no exact boundaries, token-single provides only token-level information. 
1. All annotations are in `BIOSE` format (`B`=Begin, `I`=Inside, `O`=Outside, `S`=Singleton, `E`=End).
1. Widely-used OntoNotes entity category set: `GPE` (geo-political entity), `PER` (person), `LOC` (location), `ORG` (organization), `FAC` (facility), `EVE` (event), `WOA` (work-of-art), `ANG` (language), `DUC` (product).
1. NEMO includes NER annotations for the two major versions of the Hebrew Treebank, UD (Universal Dependency) and SPMRL. These can be aligned to the other morphosyntactic information layers of the treebank using [bclm](https://github.com/OnlpLab/bclm)
1. Nested mentions. (Only the first, widest, layer is used in the NEMO¬≤ paper [1])
1. Guidelines used for annotation are provided.
1. Corpus was annotated by two native Hebrew speakers of academic education, and curated by the project manager.
1. Annotation was performed using [WebAnno](https://webanno.github.io/webanno/) (version 3.4.5)


## Legend for Files and Folder Structure
1. The two main data folders are `ud` and `spmrl`, corresponding to the relevant Hebrew Treebank corpus. 
1. Both contain a `gold` folder of gold curated annotations. 
1. Each `gold` folder contains files for the three variants (morph, token-multi, token-single) for each of the treebank splits (train,dev,test).
1. Each `gold` folder also contains a `nested` subfolder, which contains all layers of nested mentions (the first layer is the layer used in the non-nested files, and in the NEMO¬≤ paper [1])
1. The `ud` folder also contains an `ab_annotators` folder, which contain the original annotations made by each annotator (labelled `a`, `b`).


## Aligned Treenbank Versions
 
The NEMO corpus matches the treebank version of [bclm v.1.0.0](https://github.com/OnlpLab/bclm/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha).
This version is based on the [HTB UD v2.2](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Hebrew-HTB/releases/tag/r2.2) and the latest SPMRL HTB version. 
The changes contain (but might not be limited to the following):
1. Flagged and dropped duplicate and leaking sentences (between train and test). In addition to the sentences already removed in the bclm v1.0.0 HTB version, the following duplicate sentences were dropped as well (SPMRL sentence IDs): 5438, 5444, 5445, 5446, 5448, 5449, 5450, 5451, 5453, 5459 (in the bclm dataframes, these are marked in the `duplicate_sent_id` column).
To read the treebank (UD/SPMRL) in a way that matches the NEMO corpus, you can use the following:
```python
import bclm
dropped = [5438, 5444, 5445, 5446, 5448, 5449, 5450, 5451, 5453, 5459]
spdf = bclm.read_dataframe('spmrl') # load SPMRL treebank dataframe
global_dropped = [spdf[spdf.sent_id==d].global_sent_id.iat[0] for d in dropped]
uddf = bclm.read_dataframe('ud')  # load UD treebank dataframe
uddf = uddf[(~uddf.global_sent_id.isin(global_dropped))] # remove extra duplicates 
spdf = spdf[(~spdf.sent_id.isin(dropped))] # remove extra duplicates
# The resulting dataframes contain gold morph NER labels in the `biose_layer0`, `biose_layer1`... columns.
```
2. The UD treebank contains many more duplicates. In this version: all sentences exist in both UD and SPMRL versions, and all sentences and tokens are aligned between UD and SPMRL.
2. Fixed numbers that were originally reversed.
2. Fixed mismatches between tokens and morphemes.
2. Added Binyan feature.
2. No individual morphemes or tokens were added or removed, only complete sentences.

    abstract = "The Hebrew treebank (HTB), consisting of 6221 morpho-syntactically annotated newspaper sentences, has been the only resource for training and validating statistical parsers and taggers for Hebrew, for almost two decades now. During these decades, the HTB has gone through a trajectory of automatic and semi-automatic conversions, until arriving at its UDv2 form. In this work we manually validate the UDv2 version of the HTB, and, according to our findings, we apply scheme changes that bring the UD HTB to the same theoretical grounds as the rest of UD. Our experimental parsing results with UDv2New confirm that improving the coherence and internal consistency of the UD HTB indeed leads to improved parsing performance. At the same time, our analysis demonstrates that there is more to be done at the point of intersection of UD with other linguistic processing layers, in particular, at the points where UD interfaces external morphological and lexical resources.",
